# RLND-Navigation
Navigation project for Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree


## Introduction
In this project, the environment is built on top of **Unity ML-Agents**. The project goal is to implement an AI agent to learn how to navigate and collect yellow bananas in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to: 
0 - move Forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment wihtin 1800 episodes.
